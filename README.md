## BindMind: Online Yoga Learning management System(ELMS) <img src="/screenshots/logo.png" width="64" height="64">
BindMind is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of yoga learning courses and certification programs. BindMind is focused on online learning delivery but support a range of uses, acting as a platform for online content, including courses, both asynchronous and synchronous based. It show cases the following:
1. Courses
2. Student Dashboard
3. Instructor Dashboard
4. Creating, Grading and Submitting assignment
5. File upload and download supported.

The UI is build upon Material Dashboard. Material Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.

This product came as a result of users asking for a material dashboard after we released our successful [Material Kit](http://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit). We developed it based on your feedback and it is a powerful bootstrap admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content managements systems and CRMs.

Material Dashboard comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the card headers (blue, green, orange, red and purple) and an option to have a background image on the sidebar.

Material Dashboard uses a framework built by our friend [Federico - Bootstrap Material Design](http://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/), who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to his team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.
